                    <h2>The history of the republic of venice or serenissima</h2>
                    <p>The Republic of Venice born on 697 from the independence of the city by the Venetian people, threatened from the Longobard invasion of Italy. It was leaded by Doge, like an Emperor and the first was Paoluccio Anafesto. This part is really important because the Doge was elected by the Venetians family, to conduct the city at the glory.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, the Republic of Venice was one of the most important commerce point in the Adriatic Sea and it had commercials routes with Asia. It has partecipated at the Crusades in ~1100 and it consolidated its power, thanks to a big relationship with the Byzantine Empire.</p>
                    <p>It will survive until 1797 and it has been one of the most important Republic, and with Genoa, Pisa and Amalfi were called Maritime Republic. It will fall by the hand of Napoleone during the Italy Campain and then it will join the Austro-Hungaric Empire in 1798, after the Treaty of Campoformio between Frenchs and Austro-hungarics. Venice has created a lot of important things, as the first Big Council elected by Concione, St. Mark's Basilica and the Oldest Jewish Ghetto.</p>

                    <h2>The meaning of the widged lion</h2>
                    <p>During his history, Venice has conquered a lot of cities and there are a legends for this. Most of the cities still have the winged lion statue with a Book, inside this there are some words "PAX TIBI MARCE EVANGELISTA MEVS" that means "may peace be with you my evangelist". There are some particular statues:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Open book is considered a symbol of state sovereignty (numerous are the depictions of the doges kneeling in front of this representation);</li>
                        <li>Closed book alone is instead considered a symbol of delegated sovereignty and therefore of the public judiciary;</li>
                        <li>Open book (and the sword on the ground not visible) is popularly considered a symbol of the condition of peace for the Serenissima, but this is not supported by any historical source;</li>
                        <li>Closed book and the sword held is instead popularly, but erroneously, considered a symbol of the condition of war;</li>
                        <li>Open book and the gripped sword would finally be a symbol of public justice.</li>
