                                <h2>THE MEANING OF THE WIDGED LION</h2>
                                <span class="top"><span>During his history, Venice has conquered a lot of cities and there are a legends for this. Most of the cities still have the winged lion statue with a Book, inside this there are some words "PAX TIBI MARCE EVANGELISTA MEVS" that means "may peace be with you my evangelist". There are some particular statues:
                                    <h3>Open book is considered a symbol of state sovereignty (numerous are the depictions of the doges kneeling in front of this representation);</h3>
                                    <h4>Closed book alone is instead considered a symbol of delegated sovereignty and therefore of the public judiciary;</h4>
                                    <h5>Open book (and the sword on the ground not visible) is popularly considered a symbol of the condition of peace for the Serenissima, but this is not supported by any historical source;</h5>
                                    <h6>Closed book and the sword held is instead popularly, but erroneously, considered a symbol of the condition of war;</h6>
                                    <h7>Open book and the gripped sword would finally be a symbol of public justice.</h7></span>
